# Orientation

- Confirm setup
  > The **Live Share** plugin in **Visual Studio Code** has a built in feature that allows you to do voice chat with your partner over Liveshare. For the first session it is recommended that you use Zoom/Hangouts/Teams/ect. to connect, incase one or both parties has difficulty connecting over Live Share.
  >
  > If you prefer to use Live Share for both pairing and voice chat it should be sufficient for future sessions.

    - > The best practice would be to use Zoom/Hangouts/Teams/ect. Having video turned on helps with engagement and communication. Also, Occasionally Live Share may have latency issues, so using a separate applciation for voice & video reduces the likehood disruption.
    - > If Live Share proves to be particularly problematic because of a bug or unexpected issues, consider screen-sharing. Out of the aformentioned video-chat services, **Microsoft Teams** seems to provide the best video quality for sharing your IDE. (Be sure to adjust the size of your on-screen font so that its comfortable for your partner.)
